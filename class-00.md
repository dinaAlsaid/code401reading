## Thinking like a programmer

First you have to understand the problem, one method is to explain it to someone else or to a rubber duck (hehe cute).
Then you plan your solution and divide it into smaller problems to get you closer to the answer and start with the simplest.
When stuck debug, reassess or research. Also make sure to not look for a solution for the big problem instead look for a solution for the smaller sub problems and this will help you practice and learn.

## Solving programming problems

Most common mistake to do when starting to write code for a problem is to start writing code immediately.
To avoid having so many bugs and errors from the first time, use the following steps.

1. Read the problem completely twice: this step is the most important. If you don't understand the problem you will not be able to solve it.
2. Solve the problem manually: write each step of how you brain thinks of solving the problem and why that step is done.
3. Optimize the manual steps: rearrange and reconstruct the previous steps.
4. Write the steps as pseudo-code: this will reveal the structure of the code we are going to write.
5. Replace the pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

The first three steps are the key to this process and are what you should dedicate more time to when solving a programming problem.

## The 5 whys method

The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you go down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.
A counter-measure is differernt from a solution, where it prevents the problem from appearing again rather than masking it.
This method is suitable for simple or moderately difficult problems and may not be effective for larger more complex problems.
How to use it?

* Gather a team and stay focused.
* define the problem.
* ask the first why, and find answers that are actually happening not just guesses.
* ask why four more times, asking why to the previous answers.
* know when to stop, which is when you stop getting useful responses/answers.
* address the causes.
* monitor your measures/solutions to make sure you are getting the expected outcome.
