## Review

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:

* Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
* Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
* Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
* Receive authorization code
* Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
* Make a request to the access token endpoint
* Receive access token

2. What can you do with an authorization code?
exchange it for an access token, where the user can see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.
3. What can you do with an access token?
Allows an application to access an API
4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
