## Review

1. Why is access control important?
minimize the risk of unauthorized access to physical and logical systems.
2. Describe an application that would need access control.
a blog that has an admin that can read write, edit, approve and delete articles, an editor that can read write and edit, a writer that can read and write articles and a visitor that can read
3. What is a role used for?
to limit access of users to certain functionalities in a web app and organize their duties and capabilities.
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

## Term

Authorization: the process of granting or denying access to a network resource which allows the user access to various resources based on the user's identity.
Role Based Access Control :Assigning system access to users based on their roles in the organization

## Event-driven programming

Event-driven programming is a programming pattern based on performing functions when an event is occuring.
Node.js provides a module called `EventEmitter` that will help incorporate event driven programming.
We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported weâ€™ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.  

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;
```

using `on` method for the EventEmitter we can attach an event listener to it.  
To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the `removeListener` or `removeAllListeners` method.  

[list of events in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)

* Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.  
* When the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached to that specific event are called synchronously. Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and discarded.  
* an ordinary listener function is called, the standard this keyword is intentionally set to reference the EventEmitter instance to which the listener is attached.
* It is possible to use ES6 Arrow Functions as listeners, however, when doing so, the this keyword will no longer reference the EventEmitter instance
* Using the `eventEmitter.once()` method, it is possible to register a listener that is called at most once for a particular event. Once the event is emitted, the listener is unregistered and then called.
