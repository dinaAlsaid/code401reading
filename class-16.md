## Event-driven programming

Event-driven programming is a programming pattern based on performing functions when an event is occuring.
Node.js provides a module called `EventEmitter` that will help incorporate event driven programming.
We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported weâ€™ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.  

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;
```

using `on` method for the EventEmitter we can attach an event listener to it.  
To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the `removeListener` or `removeAllListeners` method.
